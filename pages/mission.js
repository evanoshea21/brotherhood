        <h3 className={classes.smallHeader} >Articulation</h3>
        <p>If you can't articulate what you believe in, you can't defend your position with conviction and honor. Moreover, you have no personal philosophy that serves as the backbone of all your decisions and actions. That's why we dedicate a portion of our meetings to public expression.
        <br/><br/>
        Public expression involves slideshow, blogs, or other formats that you contribute and present to the group. Being correct is not the primary goal. Making a logical case and strengthening your muscle of articulation is the primary focus.
        <br/><br/>

        Confidence in expression will ultimately aid you in creating meaningful connections, standing up for what you believe in, getting a promotion or raise at work, meeting and courting your future partner, and more.</p>

      <div className={classes.col2}>
        <h3 className={classes.smallHeader} >Mentality Training</h3>
        <p>The only thing that man can control is the contents of his mind. Here we foster a powerful self-Identity and practice positive Self-talk as it massively impacts success and self-worth. Without mental stoicism and discipline, man lays at the mercy of his environment.
        <br/><br/>

        Guiding philosophies include Stoic teachings, psychological studies, methods used by cultural high performers, and  from wisdom discussed by the group.
        <br/><br/>

        The skill of mastering your mind will aid you in becoming more disciplined, controlling your emotions, raising your stress tolerance, and ultimately becoming more successful as your mental endurance and self-belief will power you through adversity.</p>
      </div>
      <div className={classes.col3}>
        <h3 className={classes.smallHeader}>Accountability</h3>
        <p>You are the average of the 5 men you surround yourself with. It's time to start surrounding yourself with Winners.
        <br/><br/>

        Excuses aren't tolerated here, and the goals you set yourself will become the mission by which you're committing to. And the tribe will support you until you achieve them.
        <br/><br/>

        Accountability is a superpower among men; you will inevitably start conquering when your fellow man believes in you and expects you to win.
        <br/><br/>

        Having a support network that believes in you and your success creates a FORCE for you to achieve. And when times get hard, you have men picking you back up. Men are stronger when they fight in packs, and you will feel that here.</p>

    <h3 className={classes.header}>Expectations of the Brotherhood</h3>
    <p className={classes.para} >The most powerful thing about this organization is the brotherhood. When you look to your left and right and there before you stands a badass motherf*cker, your mindset will become warrior-like.
    <br/><br/>

    Above all, this group values the support of one another.
    To ensure this, a zero-tolerance rule is in place for anything that jeopordizes one's confidence and takes power away from them. This includes shaming or belittling in any form. We are here to help each other grow, and we celebrate each others victories.
    <br/><br/>

    If one of us is victorious, we ALL WIN.

</p>

    <h3 className={classes.header}>The Plan</h3>
    <p className={classes.para} >
    <span>Phase 0: Founding Fathers</span>
    <br/><br/>

    Recruit an initial group of men to cultivate the spirit of the warrior mindset. All meetings will start online (discord) until phase 1 is achieved.
    <br/><br/>

    <span>Objectives:</span>
    <br/><br/>
    Develop a solid week-to-week schedule where consistent growth is achieved by all members
    <br/><br/>
    Develop the rules that will govern the the organization (developed by founding/initial members). This includes setting roles and responsibilities to members willing to contribute
    <br/><br/>
    <br/><br/>

    <span>Phase 1: Become Official (in-person meetings)</span>
    <br/><br/>

    Becoming financially self-sufficient as an organization, with the PRIME goal of attaining space to host our meetings in-person.
    <br/><br/>
    <br/><br/>

    <span>Phase 2: Tentative....</span>

    This group was founded by Evan O'Shea based
    out of Everett, WA. He was tired of seeing an epidemic of young and alone men with no purpose and reason to fight. He whole-heartedly believes that men are stronger when they hunt in packs and when they are unified with purpose. In this context:
    <br/><br/>

    To become as strong and capable as possible to fight against physical and mental suffering so they can provide for themselves and the one's they love.
